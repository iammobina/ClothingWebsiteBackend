# Backend Project

This repository contains my project for the System Analysis and Design Course at Iran University of Science and Technology.

The project contains all the codes that are necessary for developing backend of a website
including connecting to a database , save information , authentication check and etc.


This project is restful which means that the code on the client side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the server side can be changed without affecting the operation of the client.


The main idea of this project is to design clothes that each user can design different dresses according to their clothing taste.
This site also allows users to create styles with clothes for themselves or to earn money.

A final method for earning money is by selling the design or styles that they created, to different companies, who will then pay the user in return for the use of the design

## Language

The Project is written in python(django rest framework).
